# Standard Pipeline Client Removed

## Reason for Removal
This file violated the bacterial programming principles:
- Single file exceeded 1257 lines (limit: 500 lines)
- Over-engineered 11-module pipeline architecture
- Excessive complexity for simple API client functionality

## Replaced By
The existing `client.ts` already provides all necessary functionality following:
- Zero hardcoding principle
- Zero fallback principle  
- Bacterial programming (modular, small, self-contained)

## Project Owner
Jason Zhang

## Date Removed  
2025-08-10

The file has been renamed to document this architectural decision.
