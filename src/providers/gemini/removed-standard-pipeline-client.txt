# Standard Pipeline Client Removed

File: standard-pipeline-client.ts (1257 lines)

## Reason for Removal
Violated bacterial programming principles:
- Single file exceeded 500 line limit  
- Over-engineered 11-module pipeline architecture
- Excessive complexity for simple provider functionality

## Replaced By
The existing client.ts provides all necessary functionality following Zero Hardcode and Zero Fallback principles.
