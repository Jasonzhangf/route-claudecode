# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating and adapting the comprehensive rule system from the `.claude` directory to Kiro's steering system. The goal is to transform the existing Claude-specific rules and project details into Kiro-compatible steering documents that can guide AI assistants working within the Kiro environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro, I want the AI assistant to follow the same comprehensive programming and architecture rules that were established in the Claude system, so that code quality and consistency are maintained across different AI platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI assistant is working on code changes THEN it SHALL reference and follow the core programming rules including zero hardcoding, zero fallback, and bacterial programming principles
2. WHEN architectural decisions are being made THEN the system SHALL enforce the six-layer architecture design principles
3. WHEN testing is required THEN the assistant SHALL follow the STD-6-STEP-PIPELINE testing methodology
4. IF any rule violations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately stop and require rule consultation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the steering system to include detailed project architecture information, so that AI assistants understand the system's structure and can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on provider implementations THEN the assistant SHALL understand the four-layer architecture (input→routing→output→provider)
2. WHEN modifying routing logic THEN the system SHALL enforce category-driven routing principles
3. WHEN implementing new providers THEN the assistant SHALL follow the unified provider interface standards
4. IF cross-node coupling is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the implementation and require single-node implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the steering system to include memory management rules, so that important architectural decisions and experiences are preserved and referenced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering problems THEN the assistant SHALL first check the project memory directory
2. WHEN making architectural changes THEN the system SHALL require calling the memory expert to save experiences
3. WHEN completing long tasks THEN the assistant SHALL have memory save and retrieval mechanisms
4. IF memory consultation is skipped THEN the system SHALL refuse to continue with the task

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the steering documents to be organized and easily navigable, so that specific rules can be quickly found and applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for specific rules THEN the steering system SHALL provide clear navigation and categorization
2. WHEN working on different types of tasks THEN the assistant SHALL know which specific steering documents to consult
3. WHEN rules are updated THEN the steering system SHALL maintain consistency across all related documents
4. IF multiple steering documents conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear precedence rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance person, I want the steering system to include compliance verification mechanisms, so that all work follows the established standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is performed THEN the assistant SHALL complete a mandatory self-check against the steering rules
2. WHEN violations are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically reject the operation
3. WHEN architectural changes are made THEN the assistant SHALL verify compliance with all relevant steering documents
4. IF compliance verification fails THEN the system SHALL require remediation before proceeding
