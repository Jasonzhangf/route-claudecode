# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a complete architectural rebuild of the Claude Code Router project to fully align with the .claude architecture rules and standards. The project will be rebuilt from the ground up with architecture-first development, moving existing implementation to OLD_implementation and creating a new clean implementation that strictly follows the six-layer architecture with dynamic registration, comprehensive debugging systems, and integrated testing frameworks.

The rebuild aims to create a production-ready, maintainable, and scalable AI routing system that serves as a reference implementation of the .claude architecture principles with full observability and mock capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Reorganization and Architecture Foundation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the existing codebase moved to OLD_implementation and a new clean architecture established, so that we can build from a solid foundation without legacy constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing the project THEN all existing source code SHALL be moved to OLD_implementation directory for reference
2. WHEN establishing the new architecture THEN it SHALL create a clean six-layer structure: Client ↔ Router ↔ Post-processor ↔ Transformer ↔ Provider ↔ Preprocessor ↔ Server
3. WHEN implementing the architecture THEN each layer SHALL support dynamic registration and plugin-based extensibility
4. WHEN processing requests THEN each layer SHALL have integrated I/O debugging capabilities that record to the debug system
5. WHEN the architecture is established THEN it SHALL include comprehensive documentation in .claude/ProjectDesign directory

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Architecture with Debug Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each architectural layer to support dynamic registration and comprehensive debugging, so that the system is both flexible and observable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing layers THEN each SHALL support dynamic module registration without requiring code changes
2. WHEN processing data through layers THEN all input/output SHALL be automatically recorded to the debug system
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL support data replay from ~/.route-claude-code/database
4. WHEN modules are registered THEN they SHALL declare their interfaces and capabilities for automatic discovery
5. WHEN data flows through the system THEN it SHALL be traceable through all layers with complete audit trails

### Requirement 3: Mock Server and Data Replay System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive mock server system that can replay data from the database, so that I can develop and test without depending on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mock server is implemented THEN it SHALL serve data from ~/.route-claude-code/database directory
2. WHEN replaying data THEN it SHALL support all provider types and maintain realistic response timing
3. WHEN running in mock mode THEN the system SHALL behave identically to production mode from the client perspective
4. WHEN debugging with mock data THEN it SHALL support selective replay of specific scenarios and edge cases
5. WHEN mock server is active THEN it SHALL provide a management interface for controlling replay scenarios

### Requirement 4: Zero Hardcoding and Fallback Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded values and fallback mechanisms removed from the codebase, so that the system is fully configuration-driven and fails explicitly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters any configuration value THEN it SHALL be loaded from external configuration files or environment variables
2. WHEN a required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL throw an explicit error instead of using fallback values
3. WHEN model names or API endpoints are referenced THEN they SHALL come from configuration mappings, not literal strings in code
4. WHEN a provider fails THEN the system SHALL report the failure explicitly rather than silently switching to backup providers
5. WHEN streaming requests encounter provider errors THEN they SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes, not HTTP 200 with error content

### Requirement 5: Test-Driven Development with Documentation Integration

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want testing documentation and implementation to be developed simultaneously, so that tests guide development and ensure comprehensive coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any feature THEN test documentation SHALL be created first to guide development
2. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL include both .js implementation and .md documentation that are kept in sync
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL generate step-by-step output files for validation and debugging
4. WHEN the STD-8-STEP-PIPELINE is implemented THEN it SHALL cover all architectural layers with comprehensive validation
5. WHEN test documentation is updated THEN it SHALL automatically reflect in the development process and vice versa

### Requirement 6: Runtime Routing Management and Dynamic Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view and modify routing configurations in real-time through a backend management interface, so that I can adjust system behavior without restarting services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the management interface is accessed THEN it SHALL display real-time routing configuration status and active pipelines
2. WHEN viewing routing status THEN it SHALL show current provider health, load balancing state, and active connections
3. WHEN modifying routing configuration THEN changes SHALL be applied immediately without service interruption
4. WHEN pipeline configuration is updated THEN it SHALL reflect in real-time processing without requiring restarts
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be validated and logged with rollback capabilities

### Requirement 7: Architecture Documentation in .claude/ProjectDesign

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want comprehensive architecture documentation in .claude/ProjectDesign, so that the design is clearly documented and guides implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating architecture documentation THEN it SHALL be placed in .claude/ProjectDesign directory with clear structure
2. WHEN documenting the six-layer architecture THEN it SHALL include detailed interface definitions and data flow diagrams
3. WHEN describing dynamic registration THEN it SHALL specify the plugin architecture and module discovery mechanisms
4. WHEN documenting debug integration THEN it SHALL explain the I/O recording and replay capabilities
5. WHEN architecture documentation is complete THEN it SHALL serve as the definitive guide for implementation

### Requirement 8: Long-term Testing Tools Ecosystem

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive set of testing tools in the ./tools directory, so that I can analyze system performance and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tools ecosystem is implemented THEN it SHALL include log-parser, visualization, data-extraction, and utilities categories
2. WHEN the log parser runs THEN it SHALL extract provider-classified data from 3456 port logs and organize it in ~/.route-claude-code/providers directory
3. WHEN the sequence diagram generator runs THEN it SHALL create HTML format interactive timeline visualizations with request-response relationships
4. WHEN tools are executed THEN they SHALL follow unified configuration management and support the --help command
5. WHEN data is extracted THEN it SHALL be stored in standardized JSON format with complete metadata and README documentation

### Requirement 9: Provider Architecture Standardization

**User Story:** As a provider integration developer, I want all providers to follow a unified interface and implementation pattern, so that adding new providers is consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
