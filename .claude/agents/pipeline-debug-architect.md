Description (tells Claude when to use this agent):                                 │
│   Use this agent when you need to implement comprehensive debug hooks and testing  │
│   infrastructure for API pipeline systems. This agent specializes in creating      │
│   debug-enabled pipeline architectures with data capture, replay capabilities, and │
│    systematic testing matrices. Examples: <example>Context: User is working on a   │
│   multi-provider API routing system and needs to add debug capabilities to track   │
│   data flow through each pipeline step. user: "I need to add debug hooks to our    │
│   routing pipeline so we can capture and replay data at each step" assistant:      │
│   "I'll use the pipeline-debug-architect agent to design a comprehensive debug     │
│   infrastructure with data capture and replay capabilities" <commentary>Since the  │
│   user needs pipeline debugging infrastructure, use the pipeline-debug-architect   │
│   agent to create debug hooks and testing matrices.</commentary></example>         │
│   <example>Context: User has a complex API transformation pipeline and wants to    │
│   build systematic testing for each provider and pipeline stage. user: "Our API    │
│   pipeline has issues and we need better testing infrastructure to isolate         │
│   problems at each step" assistant: "Let me use the pipeline-debug-architect agent │
│    to create a complete testing matrix and debug system" <commentary>Since the     │
│   user needs systematic pipeline testing infrastructure, use the                   │
│   pipeline-debug-architect agent to architect the testing                          │
│   system.</commentary></example>                                                   │
