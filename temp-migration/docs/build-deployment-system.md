# Build and Deployment System Documentation

## Overview

The Claude Code Router project implements a comprehensive zero-fallback build and deployment system that ensures reliable, traceable, and rollback-capable deployments. The system follows strict principles of explicit error handling, user confirmation for critical operations, and comprehensive validation at every step.

## Architecture

### Zero-Fallback Build System

The build system implements the following core principles:

- **Explicit Error Handling**: All build errors are reported explicitly with no silent failures
- **User Confirmation**: Publishing operations require explicit user confirmation
- **Scriptified Processes**: All build operations follow established command patterns
- **Complete Dependency Validation**: Comprehensive verification of all dependencies

### Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline provides:

- **Comprehensive Test Execution**: Full test suite execution as part of build process
- **Package Validation**: Integrity and completeness validation
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated deployment with rollback capabilities
- **Post-Deployment Health Validation**: Comprehensive health checks after deployment

## Components

### 1. Zero-Fallback Build System (`scripts/build-system.ts`)

#### Features
- Pre-build requirement validation
- Dependency validation with security audit
- Build step execution with timeout handling
- Build artifact validation
- Package structure validation
- User confirmation for publishing operations

#### Configuration
```typescript
interface BuildConfig {
  projectRoot: string;
  distDir: string;
  srcDir: string;
  requiredFiles: string[];
  requiredDependencies: string[];
  buildSteps: BuildStep[];
}
```

#### Build Steps
1. Clean previous build
2. Validate dependencies (including security audit)
3. Install dependencies
4. TypeScript compilation
5. Run tests
6. Lint code

### 2. Dependency Validator (`scripts/dependency-validator.ts`)

#### Features
- Required dependency validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Version compatibility checking
- License compliance validation
- Outdated package detection

#### Validation Process
1. Validate required dependencies are present
2. Perform security audit using `npm audit`
3. Check Node.js and npm version compatibility
4. Validate license compliance
5. Check for outdated packages

### 3. Deployment Pipeline (`scripts/deployment-pipeline.ts`)

#### Features
- Build process integration
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- Package integrity validation
- Deployment step execution
- Health check validation
- Rollback capabilities

#### Deployment Steps
1. Create deployment backup
2. Backup current deployment
3. Validate package integrity
4. Create deployment package
5. Verify deployment package

#### Health Checks
- File existence checks
- Command execution checks
- HTTP endpoint checks (configurable)
- CLI functionality validation

## Usage

### Build Commands

```bash
# Standard build
npm run build

# Zero-fallback build with comprehensive validation
npm run build:zero-fallback

# Dependency validation only
npm run validate:dependencies

# Publishing with user confirmation
npm run publish:zero-fallback
```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Execute deployment pipeline
npm run deploy

# Rollback deployment
npm run rollback
```

### Script Usage

```bash
# Build system
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/publish.sh
./scripts/validate.sh

# Deployment pipeline
./scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/rollback.sh
```

## Configuration

### Build Configuration

The build system automatically configures itself based on the project structure:

- **Project Root**: Current working directory
- **Source Directory**: `src/`
- **Distribution Directory**: `dist/`
- **Required Files**: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, `src/server.ts`
- **Required Dependencies**: `typescript`, `@types/node`

### Deployment Configuration

The deployment pipeline uses the following default configuration:

- **Deployment Directory**: `deployment/`
- **Backup Directory**: `deployment-backups/`
- **Health Check Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Step Timeout**: 5 minutes

## Error Handling

### Build Errors

The build system implements strict error handling:

1. **Configuration Errors**: Missing or invalid configuration files
2. **Dependency Errors**: Missing or incompatible dependencies
3. **Compilation Errors**: TypeScript compilation failures
4. **Test Errors**: Test execution failures
5. **Validation Errors**: Package or artifact validation failures

### Deployment Errors

The deployment pipeline handles:

1. **Build Failures**: Integration with build system error handling
2. **Test Failures**: Comprehensive test suite failures
3. **Package Validation Failures**: Integrity or completeness issues
4. **Deployment Step Failures**: Individual step execution failures
5. **Health Check Failures**: Post-deployment validation failures

## Rollback System

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Required deployment step failures
- Critical health check failures
- User-initiated rollback

### Rollback Process

1. Stop current deployment
2. Restore from backup
3. Restart services
4. Validate rollback success

### Rollback Validation

- File restoration verification
- Service restart confirmation
- Health check execution
- Rollback success reporting

## Logging and Monitoring

### Build Logging

- Timestamped log entries
- Step-by-step execution tracking
- Error context and stack traces
- Build duration and performance metrics
- Log file generation (`build.log`)

### Deployment Logging

- Deployment ID generation
- Comprehensive step logging
- Health check result tracking
- Rollback operation logging
- Deployment result JSON export

### Log Files

- `build.log`: Build process log
- `deployment-{id}.log`: Deployment process log
- `deployment-{id}.json`: Deployment result data
- `validation.log`: Dependency validation log
- `rollback.log`: Rollback process log

## Security Considerations

### Dependency Security

- Automated security vulnerability scanning
- High and critical vulnerability blocking
- License compliance checking
- Outdated package detection

### Build Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential handling
- Process isolation
- File permission validation

### Deployment Security

- Backup encryption (configurable)
- Secure package validation
- Access control for deployment operations
- Audit trail maintenance

## Performance Optimization

### Build Performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `npm install` and verify `package-lock.json`
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Check `tsconfig.json` configuration
3. **Test Failures**: Review test output and fix failing tests
4. **Permission Issues**: Verify file permissions and executable flags

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Package Validation Failures**: Verify all required files are present
2. **Health Check Failures**: Check service status and configuration
3. **Rollback Issues**: Verify backup integrity and restoration process
4. **Timeout Issues**: Adjust timeout configurations for slow operations

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Verbose build output
DEBUG=1 ./scripts/build.sh

# Deployment with detailed logging
DEBUG=1 ./scripts/deploy.sh

# Manual dependency validation
./scripts/validate.sh

# Check deployment status
ls -la deployment-*.log deployment-*.json
```
